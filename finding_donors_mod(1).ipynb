    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    " • Logistic regression is used in various fields like medical fields, and social sciences,engineering,finace and marketing.\n",
    " • Logistic regression used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, family history  \n",
    " • Strength: Predictions are clearly mapped to be between 0 and 1 through the logistic function, and the algorithm can be regularized to avoid overfitting. Logistic models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent. they work well when classes are linearly separable (separated by a single decision surface).\n",
    " • Weakness: Logistic regression tends to underperform when the data has many features. Another problem with this algorithm is that it requires large amount of data to attain stable results.\n",
    "   Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression\n",
    "Gaussuan Naive Bayes \n",
    " • Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) is used in text analytics. GNB is best algorithm for text classification. GNB is used for spam detection, classifying a news article into different articles like sports, politics etc.\n",
    " • Naive Bayes (NB) is simple algorithm based on conditional probability. It's called \"naive\" based on conditional independence (i.e. all input features are independent from one another).\n",
    " • The strength of GNB is fast and can handle large number of features, for example when classifying a text, number of features is equal to the vocabulary of the corpus which can go in to millions. Model will perform better when there is no dependency between the input features \n",
    " • One of the problem with GNB is that whenever it sees new feature value in the data, the overall probability becomes 0 because Naive Bayes is based on frequency of the feature. we set the frequency of a new unseen word to be 1 by default to avoid the zero-probability problem. we need large amounts of training data to attain stable results.\n",
    "   Reference:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier \n",
    "Decision Tree \n",
    "  • Decision Tree is being used in the field of Medicine , Biomedical Engineering,agriculture and hotriculture to solve many problems\n",
    "  • Main strength of Decision Tres is it is very simple to understand. The model works well when the model can be built with smaller trees rather than large trees. They are robust to outliers, scalable, and able to naturally model non-linear decision boundaries thanks to their hierarchical structure.\n",
    "  • Weakness: Decision tree tends to overfit very easily. To avoid overfitting problem generally use Random Forest algorithm instead of simple decision tree. Decision trees performs poorly when we have small amount of data because it overfits very easily.\n",

    "we first train our model by giving it input our historical data in the form of (X,Y) pairs where \"X\" represent the set of all features such as occupation,education_level,age, capital-gain etc. and \"Y\" represents the label(income) whether this person has donated or not.\n",

Now after finding this boundary we calculate the distance between boundary and the point if it is far away from the boundary then it means that model is more confident about the model predicting the probability of the class for the point. For prediction we give input \"X\" to the model, where \"X\" is the set of features for the new person for whom we want to predict the person will donate or not, after processing the input the model will give output the probabilities such as (0.7,0.3) for labels (\"Donate\", \"Not Donate\"), which means model predicts that there is a 70% probability that the person will donate(lable:1) and 30% probability that the person will not donate(lable:0).\n"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
